Hi I'm Fork Chili ! 

You might remember me from such great step memes as "spongebob blows a step bubble" or "steep finance, the video game".

As a self proclamed "meme legend grandmaster" I would like to share with you dear steppers, some advices regarding the art of doing memes.
You might use these advices for creativity purposes that may help you in your life in general, or maybe for step bounty purposes that will make you swim in a pool full of xstep !

So without further do, let's start ! 

## Meme mentality

Before even talking about skills and tools for meme crafting, let's take a minute to talk about the mindset you may use to create your future meme masterpiece.

Memes are powerful things that makes us smile. 
That is your ultimate goal : **To make people smile !**

So first step when creating a meme is to find an situation or a joke that really makes you say "oh man that is funny!".

**If it is not making you genuinely laugh, then don't expect it to make other people laugh.**

If it not making steppers laugh, then no step meme bounty reward for you!
