## Introduction
![hi](https://github.com/forkchili/step-meme-advices/assets/136859765/853d2a9c-4943-4536-a73d-38f5a3978774)

Hi I'm Fork Chili ! 

You might remember me from such great step memes as "spongebob blows a step bubble" or "steep finance, the video game".

As a self proclamed "meme legend grandmaster" I would like to share with you dear steppers, some advices regarding the art of doing memes.
You might use these advices for creativity purposes that may help you in your life in general, or maybe for step bounty purposes that will make you swim in a pool full of xstep !

So without further do, let's start ! 

## Meme mentality

Before even talking about skills and tools for meme crafting, let's take a minute to talk about the mindset you may use to create your future meme masterpiece.

Memes are powerful things that makes us smile. 
That is your ultimate goal : **To make people smile !**

So first step when creating a meme is to find a situation or a joke that really makes you say "oh man that is funny!".

**If it is not making you genuinely laugh, then don't expect it to make other people laugh.**

In other words : If it's not making steppers laugh... Then no step meme bounty reward for you!

## Meme bounty mentality

One last thing before jumping in pure cool tricks and tips for meme making ! Let's talk about how you should live and handle the meme bounty.

The step meme bounty is a competition, you are competing with other steppers. That means you may or may not win.

The worst thing you might think or do is complaining : "I worked so hard on that meme and did not win! :(((("

Well yes, sorry buddy but somebody did a better meme than you and it is fine !

Here are instead some VERY important things you must understand and focus on :

- Meme bounty is a weekly bounty, meaning you might win next time if you do a better meme
- If you do better memes, then it will force everybody to improve and do better memes
- Better memes globally, means more visibility for the step project (as great memes are more shared)
- more visibility means more users, which means potentially more great memes, meaning more visibility.... again and again... Or in other words, step to the moon (or to saturn... another great meme I did lol)

Or in other words : more users = more talents = better memes = more potential for visibility = more potential for step to be known = step goes brrrrr

**That is called a virtuous circle ser !**

So yeah, no matter the competion result: Learn, improve, interact and have fun :)

If making memes makes you angry and sad because you don't win the bounty, maybe it is time to stop (and look at other bounties lol)

Alright ! Now that this is out of the way, let's talk about techniques and skills shall we !

## Meme creation process

Here's, step by step, my secret recipe for creating a cool funky juicy meme :

0) Unofficial rule

There's an unofficial meme rule that you must keep in mind : 
Generally, in term of meme quality :

**video game > video with sound > video without sound (or gif) > plain image**

That rule is right, let's say 90% of the time. A nicely funny edited video will always be percived as higher quality than a random image on which you put some text.

Keep in mind that hierarchy of content before starting your meme, as obviosuly, the better you go, the longer and time consumming to craft it will get.

I am NOT saying that an image can't be funnier or better than a nice video, but my point being you REALLY must have a gem of an image and joke to compete with a video (in general).

That's the reason why, my very first meme was a gif, but then it was only videos, to recently finish with a video game.

Everybody can photoshop some text on the freaking lisa simpson board meme (not funny, stop doing that!!!), but not everybody can come up with a mario 64 rom hack level made with step logos ;)

### 1 - Find an idea

As I said before, that is, in my opinion, the trickiest part, as comedy is hard. 
Source of inspiration could be anything : look at random youtube videos, remember stuff that made you laugh, search for stupidly ridiculous situations ect... Anything could be the origin story of a meme. Just think about it and shape it !

Example :
I was at my desk and out of nowhere I remembered these lousy youtube tutorials you had in 2007, with no mic, awful music and writtings in notepad. I immediately thought "Hey ! How about a parody of this but for step?!". The idea was so funny to me that I had to make it. During the whole creation process I was crying of laughter. THAT is idealy what you're looking for !

### 2 - Estimate how difficult and how long the meme will take to do

What skills does it take to do that meme ? Which softwares do I need ? Can I even do that ? Are there videos on the internet that explains how to do this particular thing ? Do I have the time to do that right now ?

Ask yourself the right questions before jumping on a meme creation journey, as it could get long and sometimes exhausting.

### 3 - Gather everything will need

Make a list of all the images, videos, sounds you will need and gather everything in a single folder. If you have a doubt on what you need, well youtube tutorials, google search and asking around are your best options !
It is a great opportunity to learn dear stepper !

### 4 - Do the actual meme

That is I believe the part you've been really waiting for... **But Fork-sensai... How do I actually do the meme ?! What did you use to do so and so ?**.

No fear ser, I will answer it all right here ! (Everything I will list here are tools only available on computer).

- For image editing, I use photoshop, or photopea (free). It could be used for static meme image editing (for example, putting text on a freaking lisa simpson board meme... DON'T DO THAT PLEASE!!!!!!), or in my case, editing some frames of the video I am producing.

"Frames ?!" you might ask. Well yes ! Some of my videos need frame by frame editing ! I litterally export frames of the videos (using vlc screenshot functionnally because I am lazy) and edit the  to then attach them in my video editing program.

Talkin about video editing...

- For video editing, I use davinci resolve (free). 

In an editing software, you can cut, crop, move (vertically, horizontally, rotation ect...), change size ANY element imported in your project (video, images...).

All these incredible features that will help you achieve the most important thing when video editing : **manage timings, animations and layers!**

Timing : Cut correctly your videos and sound ! There should not be any delay, and with no imperfection. That is the skeleton of your video. It is not well made, your meme will not work.

Animation : If you have stuff to move, crop, reduce or increase size in your video over time, do it as precise as possible ! I hate to break it to you, but yeah, frame by frame animation is a thing lol. Search on youtube for keyframe tutorials

Layers : A video is ultimately just layers of element on top of each other, exactly as in a stack of paper. The first one on top covers the rest under. With this in mind, with all the changes you can do on each elements, well you can do VERY cool stuff !

- For voices, I use https://uberduck.ai/. It is a free website, that will generate text to speech audio clips from famous pop culture characters. I used it for spongebob and the infamous hans moleman from the simpsons. It is not perfect, but hey it's free !

- For image generation (text to image), I use a mix of midjourney, freewayml.com, dall-e, craiyon.com.
Sometimes I need a specific image or representation of something, so I use these, because you know... I can't draw :(

I used freewayml to generate all the step deformed images for the step get uncanny meme.

- Bonus tool I love to share : https://cleanup.pictures/ It allows you to remove an element of a picture. That is super cool, specially when we don't have time to do a great photoshop cleaning.

I used it heavily to remove the original bubble in the spongebob bubble meme.

- Here's a list of random software I used maybe once or twice though my meme journey. Pick up what you need lol

    - Virtualbox (for having windows xp for my xp tutorial meme)
    - OBS (for screen recording)
    - Python (for automating some quick tasks like video to frames, and also doing the fake python script "how to get rich with step in windows xp. Learn to code people ! It will always be useful !!!) 
    - Handbrake, for video format conversion
    - ChatGPT, because google was sometimes not precise enough

### 5 - Export and watch the meme

Ok, it is done. Does it work? Does it make you laugh ? Final result is great ? 
Yes ? Then time to share it with the world ! 

### 6 - Do it all over again

It is a journey, so if you like it, do it again, learn, and the ride.

My main advice here is : search and learn. Eveything can be found on the internet. You have a billion tutorial on how to do anything. Infinite knowledge my friend. Real question is not "how to do so and so", but rather "Do I want to learn it?".

Learn and improve yourself and your memes can only get better :) !

## Exclusive example of meme lord fork's skills

I want to end this long documentation with a clear example of all the skills I presented.

Let's talk about the spongebob bubble meme. That was I believe the most challenging one, as it required, animation, cropping, timing, image removal, ai voices, and frame by frame keyframe animation. 

But text is for nerds ! Here's a video to explain my point.
Cheers !
